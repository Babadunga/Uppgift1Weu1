        Maomao, a brilliant and curious young woman with a background in herbal medicine and pharmacology.</p>

        Set in a
        historical, fictional version of China, Maomao is out gathering ingredients but is kidnapped and sold into
        servitude at
        the imperial palace, where she becomes a lowly maid in the inner court.

        Despite her efforts to remain inconspicuous, Maomao's sharp mind and knowledge of poisons and remedies draw
        attention. She soon catches the eye of Jinshi, a beautiful and mysterious eunuch with a high rank in the court.
        When the emperor’s consorts begin falling ill under suspicious circumstances, Maomao quietly investigates, using
        her skills to uncover the causes behind the illnesses, all while trying to avoid getting too involved in the
        palace's dangerous power struggles.

        Through Maomao’s intellect and deductive abilities, she solves various medical mysteries in the court, gaining
        Jinshi’s favor while staying alert to the political intrigue that surrounds her. The volume sets up a blend of
        mystery, medical science, and palace drama, with Maomao's wit and dry humor adding charm to the narrative as she
        navigates the complex, treacherous environment of the imperial harem.</p>
